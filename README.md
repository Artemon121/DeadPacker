## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Compile**: Compiles the files using the resource compiler.
- **Pack**: Packs the compiled files into a VPK file.
- **Launch**: Launches Deadlock with the specified parameters.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This tool uses a [TOML](https://toml.io) configuration file to define the steps it will take. Drag and drop the config file into the DeadPacker executable to run it. The configuration file is a text file with a `.toml` extension. You can create it using any text editor.

### Example Config

```toml
# Example configuration

# Each [[step]] will be executed sequentially.
# You can add as many steps as you want and remove the ones you don't need.
# The steps are executed in the order they are defined in the file.
